# Planning README 

**Purpose:** This repo is for high-level planning for [AGU](https://www.agu.org/fall-meeting) Dec 11 - 15, 2023.

**Outcomes:** People know what's happening and when and where to find information. Discussions and decisions can happen in the open. Use this as a lightweight adaptable model for planning future events.

**Process:** README contains up to date information. [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2023-planning-agu/discussions) are used for workshop planning, travel and meetup plans, and which sessions folks plan to attend. Issues for ...issues.

## Workshop planning: Enabling Analysis in the Cloud 

Half-day co-led by NASA Openscapes Mentors. Hybrid; 30 people max.
