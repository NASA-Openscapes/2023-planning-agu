# 2023-planning-agu

**Purpose:** This repo is for high-level planning for [AGU](https://www.agu.org/fall-meeting) Dec 11 - 14, 2023.

**Outcomes:** People know what's happening and when and where to find information. Discussions and decisions can happen in the open. Use this as a lightweight adaptable model for planning future events.

**Process:** README contains up to date information. [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2023-planning-agu/discussions) can be used for things like travel and meetup plans, and which sessions folks plan to attend. Issues for ...issues.
